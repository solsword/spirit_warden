Math rules:

When division is surrounded by '^' symbols (e.g., ^x/5^), the result is rounded
up to the nearest integer. In all other cases, results of division are rounded
down to the nearest integer.

When multiple changes apply to a value, flat changes are applied first, then
all percentage changes are summed together to get a single number, and that
final percentage change is applied. So for example,

  1 + 3 + 70% - 20%

works out to

  4 + 50% = 6

Turn structure:

Each turn during phase 1, the combatants must spend (or waste) a minimum number
of action points based on their speeds. Once they have made a decision, their
moves are revealed and play advances to phase 2, where each contestant may
spend the rest of their 100 action points for the turn. When all actions are
locked in, effects from both phases 1 and 2 happen simultaneously, although
some abilities may work differently when selected during phase 1 vs. phase 2.
There's also a separate limit of one Defense, one Offense, and one Stance
action per turn.

Defenses can boost the Evasion, Block, and Resist stats, as well as Endurance.

Normal attacks have Finesse and Impact values, while invocations attacks have a
Potency value.

For normal attacks, subtract the defender's Evasion from the attack's Finesse,
and the defender's Block from the attack's Impact. Take the smaller of the two
values and add 1/2 the larger to determine the attack's Hit Strength. So for
example:

Attack - 150 Finesse / 100 Impact
Defender - 140 Evasion / 100 Block

  150 - 140 = 10
  100 - 100 = 0
    0 + 1/2 * 10 => 5

Attack - 150 Finesse / 100 Impact
Defender - 100 Evasion / 140 Block

  150 - 100 = 50
  100 - 140 = -40
    -40 + 1/2 * 50 => -15 (attack is blocked)

In general, it's better to Block high-Finesse low-Impact attacks and Evade
low-Finesse high-Impact attacks.

Depending on the math, an attack can fall into several different categories:

 Total:    Finesse - Evasion:    Impact - Block:   Category:

 <= 0              <0                 <0            Miss
 <= 0              <0                 >0            Miss
 <= 0              <0                 >0            Block
  > 0              <0                 >0            Glancing Hit
  > 0              >0                 <0            Light Hit
  > 0              >0                 >0            Strong Hit


The target of an attack loses Fortitude equal to the Hit Strength of the
attack, modified by Endurance: Fortitude lost = ^Hit Strength * (1 - Endurance)^

Hit Strength - 20
Endurance - 2%

  Fortitude lost: 19
